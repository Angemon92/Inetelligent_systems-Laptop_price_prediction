##<a name="atp"></a>About the project
Everytime we want to sell something, following question appear `what is the good price for my selling item ?`
There are two ways to give the answer:   
1.Surf the internet, looking for prices of laptops with similar characteristics (attributes in the following text) as yourown.   
2.Use machine learning to get optimal, **best price** (not too expensive neather cheap), based on near 40000 laptops collected from EBay API.

The aim of this project is, as it was expalined, to help the user to **name the price** of laptop that he wants to sell. Every laptop have several attributes from which depend its value. 
In this project will be shown whole process from:
* Collecting the data
* Filltering data
* Applying machine learning techniques for regression problem and evaluation

###<a name="cd"></a>Collecting the data
- Story about application logic
   
###<a name="fdea"></a>Filltering data and exploratory analysis
   
Story about constraints for removing noise and outliers from data
